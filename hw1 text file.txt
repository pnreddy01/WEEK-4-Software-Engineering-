// Explanation of what the program does: The following program has been compiled to use an interactive interface to help users find near misses of the form ( x, y z, n, k)

//The solutions are for the equation Xn + Yn = Zn (n is a power of the constants where x,y,z,n,k are positive integers) with conditions where 2<n<12, and 10<=x<=k with conditions 10<=y<=k.


// The program runs an interface where the user will input the first condition for the formula, followed by the defining factors in the equation.
// The final step is to define the variables applicable for the conditions.
// To avoid overflow the limits for every condition will be stated.
// The code is made using C++ in the code blocks compiler.

// THE CODE AS BELOW
// Include all the libraries needed to run C++ and maths in the language.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <limits.h>
#include <math.h>

    // Define the main integer that will return at the end of the program.

int main()
{
    // Define the first two conditions k and n

    int n = 0, k = 0;

    // The first condition is n, the power that is used in the equation.

    while ((n <= 2) || (n >= 12))
        {

            // The output query for the user enter n and ensuring its within the limits

            printf ("Enter integer n such that 2 < n < 12: ");
            scanf ("%d", &n);
       }

        // The second condition k is defined, which will be the range of test possibilities for x and y.
       //  The program will define the condition and scan whether the condition is met.

        while (k <= 10)
            {
                printf ("Enter upper limit k for x and y (k > 10): ");
                scanf ("%d", &k);
            }
      // The next step is looking for the near misses.
      // The code will look for integers x,y,and z
    int miss = INT_MAX;
    double relativMiss = INT_MAX;
    for (int x = 10; x <= k; x++)
        for (int y = 10; y <= k; y++)
            {
        // Defining Fermat's theorem of where there should be no equation such that (xn + yn= zn) Where n are the powers
        // The code will loop for each integer x,y and z
        // The condition will check for an overflow
        long lhs = (int) (pow (x, n) + pow (y, n));
    if (lhs < 0)
        {
            printf ("OVERFLOW ERROR!! Choose lower values of n and k");
        return 0;
        }
        // The program will check for near misses if all conditions are satisfied.


        int z = (int) pow (lhs, 1.0/n);
        int diff = lhs - pow (z, n);
        if ((pow (z + 1, n) - lhs) < diff)
        {
                diff = pow (z + 1, n) - lhs;
              z++;
        }
        // Check for all available conditions

        double relDiff = 100. * diff / lhs;
        if (relDiff < relativMiss)
            {
                miss = diff;
        relativMiss = relDiff;
        printf ("x = %d, y = %d, z = %d, miss = %d, relative miss = %.6f%%\n", x, y, z, diff, relDiff);
